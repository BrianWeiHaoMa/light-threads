# threads-package
A User-Level threads package with preemptive threading (threads can give control over to other threads depending on the scheduler). A CSC369 assignment (passed 100% of test cases) in 2022 that proved to be of a great challenge to me and required a lot of persistance in order to finish properly. Has the bare minimum for a threading package including mutex locks.
